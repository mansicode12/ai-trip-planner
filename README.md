## 🧭 How It Works

Just tell the planner:

🔹 Choose your **destination** 🗺️  
🔹 Select your **budget** 💰 and **spending preferences**  
🔹 Indicate the **number of days** 📅 and whether you're traveling **solo**, with **family** 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦, or with **friends** 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

And in return, our AI planner will provide:

✅ A detailed **day-by-day itinerary** 📝  
✅ Best **accommodation options** within your budget 🏨  
✅ **Travel suggestions** tailored to your interests and needs ✨
